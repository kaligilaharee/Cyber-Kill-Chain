# Cyber-Kill-Chain
The cyber kill chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, helping organizations identify and prevent attacks by breaking them down into phases such as reconnaissance, weaponization, and data exfiltration. Developed by Lockheed Martin, it aims to enhance cybersecurity by allowing defenders to disrupt attacks at various stages.
