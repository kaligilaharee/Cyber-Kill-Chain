The cyber kill chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin to understand and prevent cyberattacks. It breaks down the attack process into distinct phases, allowing organizations to identify and disrupt attacks at various stages.
Stages of the Cyber Kill Chain
Phase	Description
1. Reconnaissance	The attacker gathers information about the target, identifying vulnerabilities and potential entry points.
2. Weaponization	The attacker creates malware or exploits tailored to the identified vulnerabilities.
3. Delivery	The attacker transmits the weapon to the target, often through phishing emails or compromised websites.
4. Exploitation	The malware is activated, exploiting the target's vulnerabilities to gain access.
5. Installation	The attacker installs malware to maintain access to the target system.
6. Command and Control	The attacker establishes a command center to control the compromised systems remotely.
7. Actions on Objectives	The attacker takes actions to achieve their goals, such as data theft, destruction, or ransom.
